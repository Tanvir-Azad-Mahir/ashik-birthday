    <p>
      Dear Ashik,<br><br>
      Happy Birthday, my love! 🎂❤

From the days we ran around as carefree kids to now, miles apart but hearts so close , you’ve always been my favorite person.<br><br>

I miss you every single day, but I’m also so grateful that no matter the distance, nothing has changed between us 🩷<br><br>you still make me smile like you did when we were little.

I hope your day is filled with laughter, warmth, and everything you dream of.<br><br>You deserve all the happiness in the world and I hope I get to be there by your side soon to share it all with you. 🎁✨

Forever cheering for you, loving you, and counting days till we meet again.<br>Until then, you live in my heart - every beat, every second. 
Happy Birthday again, my childhood favourite (Bro 😉), my love 😘<br>
      Mysha 💕
